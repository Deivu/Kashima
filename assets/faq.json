    "answer": "If you have problems on vote system, make sure you checked the following. \n1. Did you vote in the right account? To check, go to Kashima's voting page with Incognito mode or Private Mode, then login the right account there, if you can vote then you may have voted in wrong account.\n2. Let it refresh, usually it takes about less than a minute up to 5 minutes, but it would depend on their servers on how fast they can give the data to us."
